It was very vigorous because, of course, we are talking about people’s lives, servicemen’s lives, and, indeed, I suppose what happens to them after they pass away as well. In that regard we were in a position to be able to support this bill, to be able to allow it so that veterans could, in fact, gain while we are in Parliament. Who knows what happens after the end of this election. We were of the view that it was far better to make some gains now than not to allow this bill to move through the various readings. We chose, accordingly, to enter into negotiations with the Government and the Minister of Veterans’ Affairs over points that we believed would advance the bill in its original form to something that we believed would have far bigger coverage. \r\n        ']"

We saw this simply as an opportunity that could be not missed out. We did, in fact, have at the very heart of our submissions and our thoughts the many veterans who are hanging out on taking up the opportunities that come from this bill and, indeed, to ensure that we captured as many people as possible into the net to allow them to access the benefits that come from this bill.\r\n        ']"

One was Wesley College, and I in my day played Wesley College, and because that was pretty much one of the closest schools to St Stephen’s School, when it was alive, it was always a very, very hard game.

In respect of autonomy and accountability, in this bill Ministers will no longer be responsible for any aspect of the trust's administration. For example, where previously the Minister for Māori Development has appointed trustees, beneficiaries will now elect their representatives. This is as it should be—the owners and trustees making decisions about the land for themselves. ""]"

That board will hold and manage trust property within the accountabilities set out in this bill. For example, the trust board must promote the purpose of the trust so that trust property is used to the benefit of the beneficiaries. The trust board must also comply with the legal obligations, including the Trustee Act 1956, and its constitution. The constitution is a new way for the trust's internal management rules to be set out; legislation will no longer be needed to do so. The bill has minimum requirements for the constitution, and the trust's initial constitution is attached to the bill. ""]"

As reported back from the Māori Affairs Committee, the Māori Land Court is given clear jurisdiction to determine whether a person is a lineal descendant.

We need to know that since the 1930s legislation governing the trust has deemed the trust's general land to be Māori freehold land. The bill changes this. It allows general land that was deemed to be Māori freehold land to revert to general land status. Approximately 29 percent of the trust's total landholdings will revert. For certainty, this land is listed in the bill. This does not include the trust's corpus lands set aside as papakāinga, and māra kai. The trust will also be able to acquire new general title land, which will remain as general land. ""]"

Te Ture Whenua Māori Bill is an example. That bill explicitly recognises and provides for mana and tino rangatiratanga over the land. There is another example in Treaty settlements. Settling groups choose whether they receive land as Māori freehold title or in another form, and many groups do choose general land. The arrangements for general land will have no effect at all on land that has always been Māori freehold land, being approximately 71 percent of the trust's total landholdings. The protections for this Māori freehold land are reinforced within the bill, and it remains under the protection of Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. In terms of jurisdiction, the High Court will have jurisdiction for governance and administration matters, and over general land. The Māori Land Court will continue to have jurisdiction for the trust's Māori freehold land. ""]"

They are technical issues by nature. Firstly, the bill includes cross-references to Te Ture Whenua Maori Act 1993. Te Ture Whenua Māori Bill, which focuses on national matters rather than on one particular trust, has now had its first reading. After this bill has been enacted, cross-references to Te Ture Whenua Maori Act will be updated by way of consequential amendments.

How is that possible? With all that pain, you lose your land, you are scrapping all the time, year in year out. I have got a whole blimmin biography of Tītokowaru. Over years, he had five conferences to try to pull everybody together, he formed alliances up in Waikato, and then for some reason he goes flip—over to the other side.

But there is a huge contradiction, for me, being here today, actually. From memory, it was about 30 years ago, on one Tuesday night, that some of these people—those proactive initiators I talked about earlier—went to a marae up in Otaraua, which is just out of Waitara. Some of these people were plotting—sorry, they were strategising—to go down to a hui that was at the marae of the Hon Mahara Okeroa, the Ōwae Marae at Waitara. The marae was—not even they can remember—up the top. But we had a hīkoi organised. It was a big hīkoi. We got together; we had some planning. We talked about the damn Crown coming to Taranaki to talk about the settlement of Treaty claims. It was most of these people up in the gallery; I sort of was on the periphery—as you know. I watched these people plot. They said ""We\'re going to go at it from a different angle. We\'re not going to go down necessarily with placards; what we\'re going to do is we\'re going to get some blankets,""—it was not my idea or anything to do with me; it was those fellas up there—""and we\'re going to wrap blankets around ourselves, and we\'ll go down at 6 o\'clock in the morning.""

I said: ""OK; fair enough."" So we went out of the marae and we walked all the way down to the main road. We turned right. We walked down to the Waitara township. Some of those people up there had microphones. They were yelling and screaming obscenities. No, they were not. They were very kind. We were singing waiata. We got up to Ōwae Marae, and the occasion was the arrival of Sir Wira Gardiner and Sir Doug Graham, to present the fiscal envelope. I was at the back of the line—way back. Some of these people marched on to the marae. Do you know—they were against what we are doing today. So was I. We were absolutely against settling claims, on the basis that it was so unfair. How can you talk about settlement, when you are talking about only 1 to 2 percent of the real value of these claims? ']"

The first one was that we sat down. We had our blankets, and we sat in the sun on the marae, and Taranaki presented its case to Sir Wira, who was the facilitator, and to Sir Douglas Graham. It was a sad day; it was an emotional day. The two events I remember—and they are even written about in Sir Wira\'s book. He said that it was probably the most—not inspirational, but the one event that affected him so much. This is because when he came out of the marae, these people—a couple of hundred of them, sitting on the ground, with those blankets wrapped around their waists—were absolutely quiet. As I said earlier, you would think that, against raupatu, you would be pretty angry. These people—we sat quietly. No one moved. When they came out for kai, everybody said: ""Come on. Come and have kai."" No one moved. That was our anger about the fiscal envelope. ']"

He set the scene, I reckon, for Taranaki about how things would play out. His name was Aila Taylor. Aila Taylor, I reckon—I met him; a fairly humble man—but he, pretty much on his own, set the scene by saying that allowing people to put sewage, rubbish, and offload into the river, into the waterways, and into the sea, and to upset the tide and not allow people to get kai, was wrong. What he did was he went in to bat for that and put up a claim around that. So I think about Aila Taylor today because he was a simple Waitara worker from the meatworks, but he hated—and led a campaign for 34 years to stop—discharge being washed into the Waitara marine area. His claim, Wai 6, was filed on 4 June 1981 on behalf of Te Atiawa. So here we are today, talking about the settlement of some of these issues, but, for me, you cannot go past a name called Aila Taylor in the history of Te Atiawa, and, indeed, Treaty claims and settlements.

A person pretty close to me made a stand in respect of some street signs in Waitara. There was a development just recently where one of those developers up there said ""Oh, I want to name this development""—two streets; one called Dreaver Drive and the other one Masters Lane—and the iwi said ""Hey, how about, because of the history, Māori street names?"".

We have been able to support whānau with infrastructure—that is, roading, connectivity to water and to sewerage—about 176 new homes in that regard—and 36 capability building projects, including papakāinga feasibility projects and 62 initiatives to increase whānau knowledge about housing.

So it should not be coming over the top with what, sometimes, some of us might say is adult-speak and giving it to rangatahi. It just will not work. We have got to have those who are able to make the connections in the communities to get our people to participate in the election process. I understand his concern, but I can say that there is information available, I hope, on the Te Puni Kōkiri website in respect of the rolling-out of that particular project.

So it should not be coming over the top with what, sometimes, some of us might say is adult-speak and giving it to rangatahi. It just will not work.

Lewis Moeau had a long career in Te Puni Kōkiri or the Ministry of Māori Development. He was also the cultural adviser to Prime Ministers and also Governors-General. The other one was Te Rangi Karaitiana McGarvey of Ngāi Tūhoe, of Ngāi Te Rangi, and Ngāti Whakauē. I had the pleasure, even though it was a short space of time in the 51st Parliament, as the chair of the Māori Affairs Committee, to work very closely with Te Rangi. He was a tohuka of Te Reo and he worked tirelessly for the Waitangi Tribunal and also Te Whare Pāremata. I went to his tangi in Ruatōki—one of those beautiful people of the mist—where they made me welcome that I could tangi with them on such a sad departure. So I wanted to acknowledge those two who have passed away.']"

That was great. But the Tūhoe settlement could not be held up for the few, especially as everyone had stood together here in this Parliament to get the signing.

Try as I might, I have not been able to connect my whakapapa link to this particular bill, but the history and the whakapapa continues with my kōrero. This time we are focusing in on Te Arawa - Bay of Plenty, where these tribes made their home. The land wars of Waikato had finally overflowed into neighbouring areas of Tauranga Moana at Te Ranga and Pukehina, and the main players, the antagonists, who have featured so far in the Waikato Land Wars raise their heads in this bill as well. I am talking about people like Grey, Cameron, Whitmore, and Mair. But this time they faced the people of Te Arawa, and I know that the hapū of the Rotorua lakes district share a common eastern border also with Raukawa and have over many centuries forged close bonds and become kin.']"

Rotorua is the tourist capital of New Zealand, a geothermal wonderland, and it has been since Europeans discovered that the area is a fantastic attraction and experience for many, many people. The Crown actively encouraged the sale of desirable land. So with that taniwha that was created, which I mentioned in my previous speeches, the Māori Land Court, the Governments of the day along with land speculators managed to alienate the people of these three iwi from their ancestral lands. No surprises there. That was the modus operandi of the day. We know today that the Māori Land Court was not set up to help keep Māori title in those days; it was set up to do the exact opposite.']"

So I want to indulge the House, and let us stop and think about Rotorua for a minute, because I am sure all of the members of this House have been to Rotorua at least once. The drive is spectacular as you make your way in there. You can see all the geothermal wonders, and the flight there is even more spectacular. You can see the volcanic nature of the land from high above. It is also easy to see how truly significant Rotorua is in the cultural history of Aotearoa and also to the economy of our nation.\r\n ']"

It should have been these tribes here today that formed our first Tourism Industry Association and opened up the chain of hotels. Iwi Māori should have been the managers, not just the guides.

 really championed this cause at its beginnings, to Haami and others. He was one of the uncles. To my knowledge, he only had one purpose. It was water, water, water. Today, Parliament is debating it. I see his relatives today and Te Meihana comes to mind. Greetings Te Rangikāheke, relative of Te Meihana. I see the photo of Dennis, a relative within us of Ngāti Rangiwewehi and Ngāti Rangiteaorere too. He passed away in recent years. My sympathy once again to Huka. She was the one who stood at the courtyard of Tarimano when the Minister arrived before us the multitude. She was there advising us—everyone, in fact, alongside our female elder Ella—do it like this, like that. When it came to chants she was the one who led those on our Tarimano courtyard. Therefore, I extend my sympathies to all of them who have passed on and whose faces are no longer seen. Nothing could be done to avoid the inevitable, so you and we lot started this procedure.

My inner self is saying go for a greater financial return. That is my thinking inside of me. But then I ponder, gosh, only a small amount of land has been returned. But I am not going against what you are doing. You are the representative and voice with the aspirations of our people upon you. I acknowledge you for that and the input by those like Hārata, Te Rangikāheke, and others who have been dealing with this matter. Yes, I was one who found some of the things going on back home distasteful, but that is for Tarimano to sort out. I certainly will not be raising those issues here in front of these ones gathered here. So, that is that. My thoughts go back to the reasons why we went to Makahae, Tapuika’s courtyard. At that time, just a small group went because we wanted to complete the matter. Huka was there as well. We went on to the courtyard, discussed the matter, ate together, and then it was proposed that we should remain united. So, that was that.

This is the reason as I understand why The Threesome emerged, and not The Sacred Threesome as such but The Water Sources of the Threesome. Why the water sources? Because of the reference to Waiōhewa, the Kaituna River, and to our river Te Mimi-ō-Pekehāua. That was the connection, the reference to the water.

All of these situations are now yours. Enough for now; put that to the side. It has been recorded in this bill in the House of Parliament.

I think\r\n it is important because it is quite a big acknowledgment if you put it in the context of the history that they have been through. So let me just turn to English for a short while and read from the bill, the Maungaharuru-Tangitū Hapū Claims Settlement Bill. Clause 8, “Text of Crown acknowledgements”, states: “(14) The Crown acknowledges that its failure to protect the Hapū from being left with insufficient land for their present and future needs by the 1930s—(a) had a devastating effect on their economic, social, and cultural well-being and on their development and was a breach of the Treaty of Waitangi and its principles; and (b) contributed to significant population losses suffered by the Hapū before 1930, and that for too long Hapū members have endured poverty, poor health, poor housing, and low educational standards.”']"

That is how I got to know a person of that ilk, whose job it was to take students to visit and view sites that showed how Māori lived in ancient times. On one of these trips, I climbed Motutapu and it was an amazing place. This was a person from Rotorua who had never ventured out of that town and had finally made it to Motutapu, and who was being taken with other students beside him to sites that I could see before me.

In terms of historical records relating to forefathers and ancestors, that has significance. Therefore, this descendant of Te Arawa is recognising you who have arrived here. I understand the Te Arawa canoe got to the North Island, followed the coastline to Whangaparāoa, on the east, and went across as far as Waitematā, to the west. As they were travelling, this priest Ngātoroirangi was present and so it was left to him to claim sections of land as they went from Whangaparāoa through to Waitematā, by naming them. As they were travelling along, they came into contact with some places on that route and closed in on some routes.

It was a matter of huge significance that this Māori alluded to in his time. According to him, there was only one team in the entire country that took the Māori language to every nook and cranny and
 to every rugby field of the country. And who was that? It was the Ngati Porou - East Coast team, of course. My part was to merely make that statement in the House to have it recorded in the volumes of Hansard so that you and I, Pare, are able to say that it has been written into the official records of Parliament House. Yes, it is East Coast - Ngati Porou, or Ngati Porou - East Coast. An actual name of a rugby team is on record; it is a Māori name with its genesis. Let us leave that conversation there.

Huge salutations to you. When I rose for the first time to speak at the first reading of this bill last year, this is what I said: “As we debate this bill there are two concepts that we, the Māori Party, wish to present before Parliament. Firstly, there is the activist chant ‘honour the Treaty’, and, secondly, there is the legacy of Sir Apirana Ngata’s phrase ‘the price of citizenship’. Both are connected intimately in this bill.” That was in my address at the first reading of this bill.

But most enjoy being able to walk between cultures with comfort and the chance to understand life from different perspectives. I feel excited about it because they’re doing the groundwork to help us understand who we’re becoming as a nation.” What I make of the situation is that our thinking about how we live should be like that. There are other Māori Ministers referred to here, like Dover Samuels, whose name originated from England. The name Sharples is from the Bolton clan in England. Our grandchildren have blue eyes. When a Pākehā marries a Māori, and a Māori marries a Pākehā, our bloodlines are still there being combined under the love of one for the other.

So, at this point in time, I say that the view of the Māori Party has not changed in respect of our soldiers, our militia of the God of War, being withdrawn and brought home. That war was not ours; it belonged to someone else. This was always the unequivocal view: that they be withdrawn and returned home.

What kind of work did he do? I do not really know. I am not sure what he did in former times, but in recent times he became more grandfather-like and an elder.

Enough, I must deliver my farewell tribute to him. He is seen no more and no longer with us, but he was from that generation of hard workers. They went anywhere to seek this thing called employment. Be it a good job or a bad one, they sought all avenues to secure a job. And so I empathise with that type of generation. That was the generation that sought work regardless how they felt.

The challenge in confronting the battle of benefit dependency is not a new one. Sixty-six years ago, Hēnare Waitoa composed a song. The name of this song was “Pension Money”. It was composed to encourage Ngati Porou to vote for Sir Āpirana Ngata when he was a member of Parliament, even though that fine old
 gentleman did not support pension dependency. It was not as though he crusaded on his own against this. Another of that tribe of Ngati Porou, Tuini Ngāwai, composed a song. Through her song she suggested that reliance on the pension would render their Māori thinking and Māori ways useless. I have similar views about the pension. I do not accept at all the notion that 31 percent of working-age Māori should be enslaved by being on a benefit. That is 112,000 people on the benefit. That is really too high.

That sort of talk, however, is not sweet to some. If dependency on benefits gets too long, other considerations come up, such as lack of education, poor health, and low self-esteem and hope, as mentioned in Tuini Ngāwai’s song that I mentioned. If that became the situation, in time successive generations would become totally dependent on benefits or pensions. That is how it will end up. It is a bit like that in smaller towns like Tokoroa and Kawerau. This is the situation in towns where there are no jobs. So the Māori Party will not support a march related to benefits that encourages a person to remain on the benefit, but we will remain shoulder to shoulder with the destitute, the children, and the grandchildren. This is the problem. The two things are at loggerheads with each other. We have a double-edged situation with each other. Yes, we want non-dependency on benefits, and we want to find employment for the well-being of the person.

Our response is that we want people to get off the benefit. But we know for a fact that this is a difficult time, and despite it being the vision, the hope, and the dream, it is not possible under the difficult circumstances. In a report from the Minister’s department, the Ministry of Social Development, just a month ago it stated that the gap between rich and poor is wider than ever. In that report, as well, it said that hardship rates for children had increased. Māori and Pasifika ones had fared particularly poorly during the recent economic downturn in communities like Kawerau. So children and youth are often the most vulnerable in a recession. The challenge, then, for us as a country is to quit the blame game and to look for avenues that are inspirational and motivating for them to succeed. Vodafone is an example to look at. It has ditched its contract with India and, as a consequence, created a hundred jobs here in New Zealand. Now this is a great outcome. In our travels, trade training is something that is talked about across the country. Those kinds of employment are applauded and must be followed up.

Firstly, the kōrerorero about this issue—the consultation, perhaps, in English. The Minister has heard, as she was talking, that the consultations will be for 18 months. That aside, the second major issue is that she, and, indeed, the Ministry of Education, have already determined the future merging process that the two kura will follow. To Melanie Couch, this merging process to be followed by the two kura makes the assumption that the two schools are similar, but they are not. They are telling the Government that each kura is distinctly different to the other. The stories and spirituality about each one are quite different.

To them, it is not as though the majority of students moved to some other place. Why has the Ministry of Education contacted and told them that your two kura must merge due to the earthquake?

First, I endorse the motion in terms of celebration for those who came here to New Zealand and those who went to the battle-front to exert themselves for what is right and valid according to some. Like what the Rt Hon Winston Peters said, it does not mean that we have to agree with what they put before us, but we must acknowledge those who stood at the battle-front—and for what purpose? For what is right and what is valid. That is that contribution.

This is what they had to say in English: “Any impracticality today results not from the Treaty but from our failure to heed its terms. The important point is that there was, and still is, room for an agreement to be made.” These words are important because they remind us that at the genesis of the Treaty was a solemn commitment for two parties to live together. We have to remember that when the Treaty was signed in 1840, the population was something like 200,000 Māori and 2,000 Pākehā.

As that points out, it is all about changing attitudes and creating an environment that enables smokers, basically, to quit. Research from the Otago University study of 1,300 smokers reported that almost 70 percent of Māori who smoke and 74 percent of Pasifika people who smoke actually supported tighter regulation of the tobacco industry. The study also showed that 66 percent of the Māori smokers and 78 percent of the Pasifika participants thought the Government should do more to tackle the harms of smoking.']"

The ill health and premature loss of life caused by smoking, particularly for Māori, as I say, is a real disgrace.

I am fairly clear that it does not solve every problem, but there is a way forward here, where it might be possible to deal with some of the issues that have been discussed behind closed doors in respect of the behaviour of some of the trusts.

If there is any doubt about why we need this, one should turn to a report from the Education Review Office, which found that only 10 percent of early childhood centres had built effective and culturally responsive partnerships with Māori whānau.

I am fairly clear that it does not solve every problem, but there is a way forward here, where it might be possible to deal with some of the issues that have been discussed behind closed doors in respect of the behaviour of some of the trusts.

I change the tenor of our speeches by addressing those who have passed away, because my sympathy is with them this afternoon. No mention has been made about the circumstances relating to the Defence Force soldier who died overseas in Afghanistan. There were no details at all about that, even though the ultimate sacrifice of serving overseas for the honour and glory of the country was fulfilled. The soldier died overseas. So I will make references to him in this farewell tribute to Corporal Douglas Hughes. He was still a young man, and that
 saddens me. He served in the Defence Force for 8 years, and now he is gone. Even though details about what actually happened are not really known, at the end of it all he will be accorded a military burial, like those who have gone before him, with farewell tributes, as well. He was part of the New Zealand provincial reconstruction team, and my sympathy goes out to him, his family, his people, and his subtribe. Young man, rest, rest, and rest there.

I know that Sir Apirana Ngata and Te Moana-nui-a-Kiwa Ngārimu were regarded as beings of this type in Ngati Porou. Hone Kaa was said to be that sort of person, as well. What is a tipua? There are a number of explanations, but broadly speaking it refers to a supernatural person, a deity, a spiritual person with enormous powers. And that summed up Hone Kaa. I refer to him because he was not just a church minister but was an advocate of preventing child abuse, as well. He took that issue before the country in recent years.

We will continue to vigorously oppose that policy, and that is why we are making this statement: protect New Zealand’s assets; keep them here. If indeed that is what National is hoping to achieve, I am thinking to myself, who better than the tribes and subtribes of New Zealand to be in partnership with? Māoridom will do a fine job of looking after assets, because they are from here. If the assets concerned relate to rivers and mountains from here, Māori and their tribes will take charge of those.

Luckily, the Māori Party spotted this and found this group working away covertly. Local people also discovered this happening. Māoridom became somewhat muted in the midst of that forum due to the secretive actions of the Government, but chose instead to confine their remarks to expressing their hurt and sadness in respect of the Treaty claims and the hurt at the intention to sell off some assets. Nevertheless, everyone said to us no, do not delete all references to the Treaty of Waitangi, do not water it down, and do not belittle the statements about the Treaty.

Because it has taken a long time, and if it does not happen, we end up in court, where a Pākehā judge will make his determination. It should remain amongst the tribe, and that is that.

There are many similarities in bills like these. Firstly, within these bills is an apology by the Crown. That is good. There must be an apology for the wrongdoing, interference, and abuses by the Crown against various tribes and subtribes in years past. It is only right that an apology is given. Secondly, what is at the heart of these problems and of these claims under scrutiny? The land is the reason. It was confiscated by a form of law; I will come back to that point in a short while. To me, the third reason is the lack of knowledge by most of the country of the commentary and history lying hidden in these bills. Most of the stories relating to this tribe and that tribe have yet to be published to the nation. When Maori put their hand up and say “This is mine under the Treaty of Waitangi.”, some people do not even consider it. Why? They do not know—that is why. So if there is something positive in these kinds of bills, it has to be that, in my view: the release of knowledge and stories about Ngāti Mākino and Ngai Tāmanuhiri to all tribes bringing issues before Parliament.

According to what I see now, let us start with you, Ngai Tāmanuhiri, for a short while. Before 1865, Ngai Tāmanuhiri owned their lands at that time. But what I see now is that you sat on the fence somewhat over the East Coast battles that year. You did not lend a helping hand to anyone else, take up the patu, taiaha, or engage in warfare. No. And yet, here you are now, occupying your lands. Eventually, and after a period of time, colonial soldiers overcame Te Waerenga-a-Hika. I understand that women and children were abused. Loss of food and land resulted. Now you can see here the similarities of the claims that have come into this House.

Further to that, there was invasion of lands by soldiers.

It was like that in other parts of the country, as well. The Public Works Act was one. What despicable legislation that was. Its job in those times was to steal the land. Now what I have read in relation to you, Ngai Tāmanuhiri, was published in the statement about the Manutūkē consolidation scheme. It is not as though I really know much about the circumstances relating to that scheme,
 but I understand that from 1958 the Crown came to an agreement and released to you some lands belonging to another tribe, as compensation for the land it stole from you in the first place. That happened elsewhere, as well. Rubbish and sewage went out to sea near Gisborne, tarnishing and damaging the coast, as in other areas. Furthermore, Ngai Tāmanuhiri had sacred sites, and what role did the Government have in that? To steal those sacred sites. So the desire to settle claims is at hand and has been reached.

A vast number of those who served on boards—ancient ones, the majority of whom at the time were men—have long since died. Therefore, the time has come to look at the new world, shall we say. From my perspective, many, many problems came out of the old trust boards, but in this day of the new world matters are somewhat different from those discussed by the old ones in their time. Therefore we must look for a way to address those problems. What alarms me is the fact that these boards are accountable to the Minister, and indeed to the Government, in terms of agreements around the release of funds, and that the mandate must come back to Ministers.

We thank them all for responding so graciously, despite the fact that we are under urgency. One of the insights we gained was from a woman named Tania Kingi, the group manager of Te Roopū Waiora Trust, who told us she was in favour of the decision to pay kaimahi support payments, because it was the fair and just thing to do. She said they should never have been underpaid in the first instance. She raised a point that I thought was really interesting, and I would be keen to hear the views of others on this issue, even if we understand that it is such a truncated process and we are reducing the select committee process to only a few days. Mrs Kingi provided us with the following comment: “Another reason that paying a real wage for sleepover support workers is important is the different needs to the different parts of the disability sector. The needs of a tetraplegic are as different to the needs of a paraplegic as the needs of an able-bodied person are to a paraplegic, yet that difference is not recognised.” She continued: “I can remember a particular case where a tetraplegic man was not getting adequate care because the funding was not in place for him to pay for two 4-hour shift workers. Instead, he was forced to hire one person for an 8-hour shift.” She wrapped it up by saying: “What happened? The worker kept falling asleep, and the man was not able to be rolled over during the night, which resulted in breathing difficulties. Proper funding is important.” She finished her statement there. I thought that was a really interesting comment about whether the higher wages that will be paid to those who take on a sleepover role will also take into account a different rate of pay for the different needs of care.']"

That brings us to another very significant issue—that is, being able to recognise the important work that whānau caregivers—family carers—do as carers of their loved ones, and whether the\r\n Government will be prepared to resource that appropriately. The Ministry of Health has a view that whānau are not eligible for carer payments, and I think we need to take a critical look at this particular policy if we are really committed towards whānau ora. It would seem to me entirely contradictory that on one hand we want to reduce reliance on the State and increase whānau self-development and independence, yet on the other hand we refuse to give them the resources they need to do the job.']"

The incremental movement from 50 percent of the minimum wage, about $60 a sleepover, gradually increasing to the full minimum wage by July 2013, will allow both the Government and the providers sufficient lead-in time to allocate the appropriate resources.

The classic recent case of this was the Appropriation (Parliamentary Expenditure Validation) Bill, which was moved through Parliament under urgency in October 2006.

It was a decision, however, that our supporters came to; in fact, they encouraged us to make that decision based on over 30 hui throughout the whole of the country. Their view was that all of the promises and the pledges made throughout the election campaign amount to nothing if we choose to throw away the best opportunity to make a difference.

Sam is based in Ōtara in Auckland. He has over 40 years’ experience in transforming communities, particularly engaging with people who have been alienated, marginalised, and have lost hope along the way. Sam talks about the triple A approach: awareness, attitude, action. The Māori Party knows that so much of the success of local communities comes when we can grow the awareness that we can manage our own affairs: that we can break the cycles of reliance and dependence on others. I suppose that is what Mr Alfred Ngaro was talking about today. It is about starting off with the attitude that demonstrates we know that we are capable of miracles. Attitude comes from a context, and the impacts of colonisation, assimilation, global recessions, and paternalistic policies of the State have led down a pathway that sets some people up, unfortunately, to fail. We choose not to rely on the State as the option of first resort—no way. So our actions must model the shifting of thinking that lifts our sights to our own solutions. We must move away from lowering our gaze to what the State can provide to, instead, building our own vision.\r\n ']"

The creation of a ministerial committee on poverty and the initiatives to urgently invest in the prevention of rheumatic fever and in home insulation, Māori education, trade training, and homeownership are huge for us for creating a better world for generations to come. I am pleased that in the Māori Affairs Committee parties from across the House will be able to contribute to this work through the inquiry into the determinants of well-being for Māori children. One of the key goals of that inquiry is that there will be an investigation into the extent of public investment in Māori children across the health, education, social services, and justice sectors, and whether this investment is adequate and equitable.\r\n ']"

One of the key platforms from that term, which will assume even greater importance in this one, is to lead the public discussion around the constitutional arrangements for Aotearoa. It was disappointing to read the comments from Mr Harawira about the importance of swearing allegiance to the Queen in ceremonies held yesterday. I think he said you just cross as many fingers and toes as you can, because it is absolutely meaningless. Well, for us—and I am sure, for him—he should know that there would be no Treaty of Waitangi without the Queen, and that the sacred covenant entered into between Wikitoria and the rangatira of Aotearoa remains highly significant to whānau, hapū, and iwi across the land, and we want to pursue that. The Māori Party is of the view, however, that swearing allegiance to Te Tiriti o Waitangi is of fundamental importance in moving forward, and our bill, the Oaths and\r\n Declarations (Upholding the Treaty of Waitangi) Amendment Bill is just one that we will be taking up to honour our commitment to our people and, indeed, to Te Tiriti o Waitangi as the foundation document.\r\n ']"

Despite what Mr Peters has said earlier, the Māori Party does not support partial asset sales, and support for such measures was not included as a part of that accord. We have also been very clear about the “agree to disagree” provision. This provision protects the independence, the mana motuhake, of the Māori Party. We have the freedom to vote on all issues on a case by case basis, other than matters that are subject to confidence and supply, which is around the Budget. That, by the way, is how we operated in the last term, and we will continue to do so in this term. We guard our independence fiercely to safeguard the strong and independent voice for Māori. We remain focused on what we will achieve in long-term gains for the next generation and how our kaupapa and tikanga will be enabled to influence this and shape the growing nation. All of those things will be achieved, we hope, in the next 3 years. That is where we will be heading. I said earlier that I would hope that all of these things that have been developed through the confidence and supply agreement, with the relationship accord, set a special precedent. The past has meant that parties with only the confidence and supply agreement are pretty much bound down. The Māori Party appreciates very much the relationship accord, which changes the tone of that relationship to give us the freedom that we have to vote where we want to and how we would like to, except on those issues of finance, and we look forward to a strong, robust 3 years ahead.

That is how bad the figures were for Māori aged 14 years or younger trying cannabis for the first time. So with these figures in front of us, we are able to see how high the risk is for Māori affected by these substances. Of course it is not just the immediate impact that poses a problem, but the after-effects that arise, such as truancy, poor academic performance, and personal behavioural problems. This bill has an advantage in that it will remove substances like Kronic, and other cannabis products like it, from shops nationwide for 12 months—for a year. Let us say that it is a time-limited ban that will give sufficient space to investigate offending substances harmful to a person. Perhaps there will come a time when they are banned for ever. Who will benefit, and who will go under?

That approach is for all procedures, as, for instance, in the promotion of health matters, early intervention, and treatment or recovery. I am talking about detoxification services, drug education programmes, doctors or clinicians, rehabilitation regimes of every kind, being accessible by Māori. As I said a moment ago, it includes Māori-based health services established and implemented by Māori from within a framework of Māori concepts and perspectives about health and well-being.

Greetings to you, the Minister in the chair, who is filling in for the Minister tonight. Much regards to you. In March this year Iris Pāhau from the Coalition to End Homelessness stated that 80 percent of those without homes were Māori—80 percent were Māori. She was speaking at a national annual conference to end homelessness, where the difficulty of this kind of situation for those here in New Zealand became a reality. It was reported that a few hundred so-called rough sleepers were those who were homeless and of no fixed abode—particularly in Auckland—as well as the several thousands of people living in boarding houses and motor camps under the wing of this thing called temporary accommodation. In addition, 4,722 people were recorded in the last census as living in some 2,295 run-down dwellings, plus more than 43,000 overcrowded households, making us aware of the sheer enormity of this thing upon the country at large and, in particular, upon Māoridom.</em>, <strong></strong>]"

I want to say how much the Māori Party appreciates the way the Minister of Housing listened to what we had to say and put before him about the situation in respect of our people housed in Christchurch and the South Island. My colleague Rahui Katene referred to those who relocated because of earthquakes and who eventually found accommodation elsewhere. What brought this about? The Minister made it happen. It was like that for me as well. Some came to live within my Waiariki electorate, and some of their Māori-medium schoolchildren attended our Māori-medium schools in my electorate.

It is only when that option has been fully explored that we look at this thing called social housing.

Regardless of what the Green Party and Labour had to say, that concern of ours remains.

We do not sit too much in the middle and judge those things, but we certainly provide an opportunity for iwi to have a say. I understood that the working party arose from a need to have a group to represent the interests of Whanganui hapū in the southern or Tūpoho region of the Whanganui district, and to talk directly with Ngāti Apa to work through any overlapping interests that Whanganui iwi had with the Ngāti Apa settlement.

The on-account settlement bill provides the working party with the right of deferred selection over a half-share in the land under the Whanganui Prison, and the northern half of the Whanganui Forest not offered to Ngāti Apa. The working party’s right of deferred selections over these properties is subject to Ngāti Apa first exercising their right of deferred selection over the forest under the prison, and the southern half of the Whanganui Forest.

There are leaky homes, decayed homes, cold homes, damp homes, and dilapidated ones present. If that is the case, there is much benefit to be gained in terms of a person’s health.
 Hopefully, as we talk about this bill, we will find time to consider the thought that yes, if the house is fine, the person is healthy as well.</em>, '\n', <strong>

According to what I know, that report states that the Treaty envisages the Crown-Māori relationship as a partnership, in future negotiations. The way ahead for a Crown-Māori relationship in the future is still there. Yet the problem is that in this bill only one side is referred to, and that is the Crown. There is nothing about the state of Māoridom. It is like what I have been talking about in terms of the Treaty of Waitangi perspective. So that is issue No. 1, perhaps.

There is an interesting irony, for example, in the detail of measures in this bill around the taking of property. The bill suggests that property can be taken, or authorised to be taken,
 without the consent of the owner, if full compensation for the taking or impairment is provided to that person. That idea is a good one if someone’s property is taken, but first they must be consulted. If that happens, they must be compensated for such an action taken against them. If we continue to go down that road, and agree that every person is equal under the cloak of the law, then I must ask the question: “What about circumstances relating to Treaty claims and Treaty settlements currently being addressed and debated?”. If the same regulatory standards applied, if we followed that kind of reasoning, Māoridom would be resourced to the hilt as a consequence of the Crown’s deceitful actions in years past. So that is a huge point to talk about and debate. Yes, if we were indeed under the cloak of the law, everyone would be equal before the law, regardless of who they might be, Māori people or others.

We urge that local Māori be involved in examining the detail of those provisions carefully to see whether any retrospective steps will be taken to address past issues that clearly fall into the category of bad law-making.

My huge appreciation to you, and indeed to us of the House, this afternoon. I rise to address the Freedom Camping Bill. As I understand it, the purpose of this bill is to find remedies that will deal with issues caused by freedom campers in New Zealand. The Māori Party supports this bill at its first reading. However, I need to point out that Māori, by tradition, are not freedom campers. At most times they stay in the home of a relative—not because they fear sleeping under the stars; not at all, that is not where the problem is. To my understanding, this kind of lifestyle has come about through campers from other countries coming to see the beauty of New Zealand. Hordes of tourists, and those from overseas in vehicles referred to here as campervans, have a strong presence in my electorate of Te Waiariki, which stretches from the Dogs of Whārei across to Tihirau, and from Maketū inland to Mount Tongariro. So I have a clear understanding of what this bill is about, and support what it is intended to do.</em>, <strong></strong>]"

According to reports at the time, freedom campers were using Ngā Niho Pā, a traditional pā site in Kaikōura, as a place to defecate. That so infuriated my colleague that it prompted her to go to the press to voice her opposition to that form of camping.

But I take on board the message from the member of the Green Party in his address to us, that the focus of this bill is particularly on campers in these vans. This perhaps is its focus. But the problem is that New Zealand is about to be inundated by hordes of people coming to watch the Rugby World Cup. Without a doubt, a large number of those people will resort to campervans to get about.

Following on from the address of that member, Nanaia Mahuta, I must acknowledge George Parr, and thank him for his huge consideration for the city of Hamilton, and this land he has gifted to the people living there. It is correct what some have said: that according to accounts, in George Parr’s oath of 1929 he gifted a building on this land as a recovery home for patients discharged from the Waikato Hospital at that time, and furthermore a playground, a recreational place solely for children. Furthermore, the legacy of this man, George Parr, in my view is his tremendous consideration for children and for those in poor health. Therefore, acknowledging him is the right thing to do. His promise is a benefit for children, and, hopefully, this is one pledge that the Hamilton City Council will ensure that children will benefit directly from. It is in the hands of the Hamilton City Council to implement what George Parr wanted in years past.

We have heard in this House that the Waikato River is not just the water alone, but the banks, the riverbed under the water, the water from the tributaries that flow into the Waikato
 River, and, furthermore, the fish and the subterranean pools. That is the view of the tribes living in Waikato-Tainui. That is the aspect relating to the river.

It was stated in the independent panel review report, Te Reo Mauriora, that we must make an earnest effort to use the Māori language, and for that reason I rise to take a short call, not a long one, to put forth some thoughts in Māori on behalf of the Māori Party. The Māori Party supports much of what is in this bill. It is right that we consider this proposal very carefully, based on what each of us has said about young people drinking and driving, and any death resulting from that. It has affected each of us in some way or other. We and the nation need to find a way to avoid that difficulty that is gnawing away inside us. Māori and non-Maori people on their own will not solve it, but everyone has to take responsibility. We have all been affected by the tragic circumstances brought about through drink-driving.

It was while we were debating away, yes or no, that we found a positive reason for raising the age. There was a problem in the case of the Hon Tariana Tūria, who said she lives on a farm in Whanganui, working alongside her husband, George. The big problem was with the children driving themselves to sports venues or other places. That was similar to what the Hon Steve Chadwick and Louisa Wall had to say about driving to sportsgrounds. I am the same, too, with my five kids. My home is in Ngongotahā, a famous place in the country, and some distance from Rotorua. It is a drive of about 20 to 25 minutes to the city, so there is a daily ritual with five children in pursuit of sporting events. So when the children get to the right age, you say to them: “OK, over to you. Buy your car; it’s over to you.” So that is that statement. But I am thinking about those in a similar situation in rural areas, on farms, and quite far away from larger towns.

If we say that we will not allow children a single drop, we will not allow an adult to have a single glass of wine or beer; do not tell them that we do not allow them to take a single drop, while an adult can take a single glass of wine or beer. Just as for adults, it will not be allowed for children. Where is the justice for children, if we say “You have to do this, but it is different for us adults.”?

Good morning to all, as we debate aspects of this new bill relating to Christchurch, at this hour. The part of the Hon Gerry Brownlee’s speech that I want to follow is where I and Māoridom fit into the scheme of things. I commend him for acknowledging the part that Ngāi Tahu or Kai Tahu has played, as they roused themselves by extending a hand in all directions to non-Māori and Māori people in their desire to help and to support one another. For Kai Tahu, it was the right thing to do. So there they were, hard at work giving assistance to those suffering from injuries, and in the case of loss of life. They were the
 ones who extended a hand to all the people of the nation. Tribes, on the other hand, extended a hand to Kai Tahu, saying: “Pain suffered by you, Kai Tahu, affects me: Te Arawa, Tainui, and Te Tai Tokerau, as well.” So that aspect of Maoridom is wonderful, in the deliberations.

There is much other anecdotal lore that suggests this, as well. The ones living in Christchurch can historically vouch for their presence there. Take the reference to “The wetlands and plains of Canterbury: Kā Pākihi Whakatekateka o Waitaha”. Here is another one: “Banks Peninsula: Te Pātaka o Rākaihautū”. All these kinds of references are widely known geographical terms in that district. To my understanding, a tribe has lived there for a long period of time. According to stories of the Māori World, that tribe has been there for 700 years. Kāti Māmoe migrated and settled there for a very long time, as well. According to stories, the place name “Turakautahi” came from a Ngāi Tūāhuriri chief. He established Kaiapoi Pā in that area. In the stories that came to me about Ngāti Huakai, their chief—a warrior, Tautahi—set up a settlement in that part of Christchurch, and Ōtautahi became the Māori name for Christchurch, to acknowledge him.</em>, '\n', <strong>

This is quite difficult to explain in Māori, but the point I am trying to make is that when it comes to this thing called Māori land, there is a different view on it because the non-Māori viewpoint is quite different. That is what I am saying here. Māoridom does not view land from an individual perspective—that is, one part for that person, and one for someone else. Absolutely not. It is a broader perspective. To the Māori, it is not an individual thing. Shares in the land are not about money, assets, or having equity. Not at all. It is essentially a viewpoint based on a lore handed down—end of story. At times, statements are made that this thing, land, is never sold by Māori people, because it does not belong to them, but rather to the elders and the ancestors. Many Māori people have shares in Māori land, but assets are not the important thing here, nor the income generated, but rather the knowledge that any accrued benefits will drop down to the children and grandchildren of the future. Furthermore, unravelling issues like these in courts is quite a difficult process. It is a huge task. So the situation in the Te Waiariki electorate currently is that because there is a vast amount of Māori land, and numerous blocks, in the Bay of Plenty and East Coast regions, a lot of time and money is wasted chasing up people who have shares in this thing called land. And many Māori do not even know they have land interests—end of story. They do not know that their information about the land is tucked away in the records of the Māori Land Court. So it is difficult. The Māori Party took this matter up directly with the Minister, but to no avail. We put it before the other parties in Parliament last night, but it never reached the threshold. But it was not for want of trying that we did not get the desired outcome.

The first one relates to clause 5. It contains an important matter relating to definitions. The Education and Science Committee examined this bill and agreed emphatically that it be passed and be allowed to proceed. It is not as though many changes are required to define this thing called the humanities. The committee recommended that a minor change be made to clause 5(2), in respect of examining the depth of the definition of the humanities, and to omit references to English and American studies, or words of that effect in the English language. In the view of that committee, it is a waste of time to specify English, because it is already in the broad statement about language types. The same can be said about American studies, because it is already there in cultural studies. So, according to the committee in that discussion, it is a sheer waste of time to make those changes in that clause.

He is a person who, to my knowledge, is reliably informed about the work of the society, having been a member of the Wellington branch for 45 years, including nearly a decade as the president of that organisation. Mr Jones noted that although America has had some influence on New Zealand culture, there has certainly been far more influence from Māori, and he suggested that Māori studies could therefore be added, in addition to cultural studies. The Māori Party fully endorses that kind of thinking, and urges the Minister to examine it more closely.

We must not forget that the Māori Language Act 1987 declared te reo Māori as an official language—almost a quarter of a century ago. We advocate that te reo Māori is the foundation language of New Zealand, the ancestral language of the indigenous people, and one of the heirlooms guaranteed protection under the Treaty of Waitangi. It also
 provides this country with a unique language identity in the rest of the world, as this is the only place where Māori is spoken widely. Yet the Royal Society of New Zealand Act 1997—introduced some 10 years after the Māori Language Act—has not included this major development in its text.

There are so many ways in which this bill could stretch its view. It could have taken a wider view towards aspects of Māori knowledge in terms of broadening that aspect. Perhaps that is just my take on things, based on the kind of talk about self-determination in relation to activities concerning science, research, and technology. That is another sphere.

How can any Government, red or blue, live with itself knowing that the rate of poverty for children in households with no full-time worker is six times—six times—higher than it is for children living in homes where there is at least one full-time worker?

In fact, he described this cycle as becoming “culturally ingrained in certain family groups”. Where does this come from? What can we do to address the seemingly intractable problems that lead to underachievement and under-participation? It is not about just a poverty of income.

The select committee acknowledged that there is an issue here, but that the optimum membership count remain at 10. They were to seek a solution such as the one suggested by Nanaia, whereby they sit at the table and discuss it there. The issue for Ngāti Maniapoto was to request that Ngāti Raukawa have an interest in the Waipā River, that Ngāti Maniapoto and Ngāti Raukawa have a place, as well, on the regional council. To Ngāti Maniapoto, the Waipā River is under the mandate of Ngāti Maniapoto because one part of the river is in the Ngāti Raukawa settlement, so they should have access to all the information, as well. I understand that according to the select committee this is a tribal matter. The Hon Mita Ririnui stated that the tribe should decide it; the Crown
 should have no part in it. I kind of agree with that, somehow. So all these comments are bits of explanation about the nature of this bill.

That stance has been long discussed around the Wai 262 claim. And that is why I said we should take a broad view in terms of these matters, as opposed to the narrow view of the humanities. In subsequent phases of this bill we will be looking for the connection between the Treaty of Waitangi, natural resources, the environment, the economy, the arts and culture, and research, science, and technology. We would also like to see a greater understanding between Māori and non-Māori cultures, and support for indigenous declarations such as the Mātaatua declaration and the Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples.

Here is Labour, defending, carrying and raising the gun, turning it in this direction so it bangs this way, and then firing it. But here is ACT, as well. It is able to raise its gun, and fire it at Labour, because of the situation of that man, the Hon Chris Carter. There is Labour again: it raises its gun, turns it towards National here, and, bang, that is Dr Richard Worth done for. National, in turn, raises its gun and aims it at us of the Māori Party. We have not lost anyone yet, but what I am implying has the same outcome. If a problem wells up amongst ourselves in our party—and it applies to us here—we can all, each one of us in this House, lift up the gun and fire it at someone else.

Although the aspirational goal of reducing State dependency is a logical one, the economic downturn, however, has actually resulted in a greater need for social security, which is significantly so for Māori people. Can that be realistically achieved if there is a shortfall in the employment sector?

We do not deny that there is an issue there. The total numbers of main benefits for all ages, excluding New Zealand Superannuation and the veterans allowance, have increased from 293,562 at the end of November 2008 to a total of 355,858 at the end of February 2010—an increase of 62,296 or 21 percent.

For instance, beneficiaries who fail to meet their obligations will be subject to a sanction of a 50 percent reduction in their benefit. The bill determines that for a first failure the person’s benefit must be reduced by 50 percent, until the person re-complies.

I commend that member, Carol Beaumont, for bringing this bill before the House, because neither side in the past has been prepared to face up to the issues around this matter. When a person falls into debt it is like dropping into a huge whirlpool in the sea called the throat of Te Parata. Its effect spirals. It creates poverty, stress, illness, a breakdown in relationships, sleepless nights, and all those kinds of things. So it is not the pocket alone that is affected, but a person’s lifestyle in this world as well. Without a doubt we all turn to banks or someone else for money. The problem for this bill is the scale of it. The amount sought by some for the house, or whatever, from the bank is huge. And that is a concern to us. Hearing the name of this person, Mr Andrew Shann, brings to mind the solid work he has done in this area. We acknowledge and appreciate him greatly. According to him, 90 percent of those who seek money are from the Pacific Islands and Māoridom; from Tonga, Samoa, and Māoridom; 90 percent of that group were ours. So we need to be careful.

The essence of what he said to the House was about the damage that anyone can do in spacies parlours. Children can be seen annihilating people by pressing a button. He said that we have made it easier for kids to go to those kinds of amenities, or to stay at home in front of a television with a PlayStation or gaming consoles and be an armchair terrorist. So we can see that technology has extended beyond the boundaries of human imagination. We can open the garage door, shut electric blinds, and turn on the TV, all by remote control. And now we have the joystick, and some of us are aware of what it can do. But here I am in a state of confusion as to the meaning of joystick, which ultimately is about killing people. That sort of talk is somewhat of an oxymoron to me. What a crazy game that is!

The country is well aware of the obsession that Māori have over rugby. Māori have been keen followers of rugby for a long time, and at this very moment a hundred years of Māori rugby are being celebrated in the country. Last Friday the New Zealand Māori team reached the pinnacle of all pinnacles, by defeating Ireland. Oh, yes! My home town of Rotorua was swamped by people and Māori. They were proud of how well the Māori team triumphed over the visitors from Ireland. Tomorrow the team will arrive in Hawke’s Bay to do battle with England, where it will be seen whether the Māori team is a great or special one—whatever it is. But one can only hope.

One such captain was Buck Shelford, who became a captain of the national side, as did Tāne Norton, Taine Randell, and others who reached that level of captaincy of the All Blacks for this country. So the real basis of my speech is to highlight the commitment of Māori to rugby.

One team served on the battlefield, the other on the playing field. Both the Māori rugby team and the 28th Māori Battalion are causes that we should celebrate in New Zealand.

We are in two minds over the fact that the Minister makes the final decisions over matters pertaining to the World Cup. Further to that, the Māori Party is somewhat concerned that the Minister of Māori Affairs is invisible, or appears to have no role, in that entity, the administrative body or the Rugby World Cup

Why is it about drinking beer and all the other alcoholic beverages? This bill is all about that—about alcohol consumption—and not about the real issues, for heaven’s sake. It is important for us to comment on that, because I recall a person from Tauranga, within my Waiariki electorate, from the Arataki Sports Club. I understand that he managed the coaches of Arataki Sports Club’s rugby teams. His name was Greg Doolan. My understanding is that he agreed to become head coach of rugby at Arataki Sports Club if the club became alcohol-free. This is a real first for rugby clubs in New Zealand. That is that story.

The goal of this bill, in terms of protecting the rights of buyers when purchasing vehicles, is consistent with that of other bills that have come before the House during urgency in days just past. The bill amends the process for motor vehicle traders to renew their annual registration. In addition, it extends the range of people banned from car trading, such as those who stoop to giving false registration information or those who have lapsed registrations. Because all these measures make pretty good sense to us, we support the bill.

The trust tells us that two cars out of 10 have children travelling unsecured, and only one in five car seats is fitted properly. We should be shocked at those figures. The trust believes there is a need to promote and protect our children from birth, and for them to be in a suitable, correctly fitted child restraint each time they are in a vehicle. And if we have to ask why we should do that, we might think of the 16 children who die each year as a result of a motor vehicle accident, and of the 275 who are hospitalised.

It has been 2 weeks since I stood proudly in the United Nations building as the Minister of Māori Affairs, the Hon Dr Pita Sharples, addressed the indigenous peoples of the world on New Zealand’s position. It is not until one stands in that building and experiences it for oneself that one realises just how broad and far-reaching statements impact on the world at large. So the Māori Party members come to this issue among the ones before us, proud of our stance to ensure that the Nuclear Free Policy remains in New Zealand. We agree to the circumstance at this moment right now; and during the discussions on issues relating to nuclear disarmament at the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons conference, to my knowledge America was involved
 in days just past, and right up to the end of this month. I support Phil Twyford, who proposed and brought this matter before the House, and acknowledge him.

Further to that, New Zealand can be proud of the stand taken some 30 years ago under the leadership of the late Rt Hon David Lange as Prime Minister, when he took this issue before the world in one of the debates in London in the very heart of England.

At the same time, New Zealand rejected the possibility of nuclear deterrence as part of a national security strategy, and stated quite firmly that nuclear armament should be taken to somewhere else. In that context, I am somewhat perplexed, because just 2 years ago Labour opposed some resolutions that the United Nations General Assembly put forward to promote a nuclear-free world. Three resolutions were as follows, and I will put them in English. The first one called for the major powers to reduce their nuclear arsenals; the second one stated that the use of nuclear weapons would constitute a violation of the charter; and the third perceived nuclear weapons as posing “the most serious threat to the survival of mankind”. So here I am wondering why Labour members should be putting this matter forward, when just 3 years ago they opposed the resolutions.

As I researched this bill carefully among others, I discovered that a huge problem erupted on the West Coast of the South Island in the town of Blackball in 1908. According to some, a local of that town refused to end his meal quickly in the stipulated time of 15 minutes for lunch. Hickey was this person’s name. Because he refused to end his meal in the allocated time, he and six of his workmates were fired. This took place at the Blackball mine. The manager of that mine at the time wanted to increase the working day to 10 hours. Eventually, the legendary Blackball strike broke out, when the union became involved because it did not want the working hours increased to 10 hours but kept at 8 hours. This matter was taken to court and the miners were fined. However, the miners refused to pay, and their possessions were seized and auctioned to raise the money to pay the fine. The miners told everyone not to buy the auctioned goods. As I understand it, this went on for 3 months, until the men were finally reinstated.

The bill states that the duration of rest breaks and meal breaks should be agreed upon between the employer, boss, or chief, and the employee. This is the nub. If this does not occur, the two must negotiate the duration of the breaks acceptable to both. I think employers and shop managers will be surprised that laws were not already in place around the provision of meal breaks for workers. So perhaps it is time that a law like this is introduced that addresses the duration of rest breaks and meal breaks, although one would think it would be a case of basic rights, like providing tea, coffee, and milk. That is the situation here in Parliament in regard to our work and environment. It is like that in shops, as well. But that does not seem to apply to most of New Zealand.

During my research, however, I also found out that at the moment, nearly 18 percent of workers in New Zealand belong to trade unions. So it appears that the majority of those not in unions, and more likely to be affected, working in jobs such as those in the hospitality industry, hotels, fast-food outlets, and so on, are young workers. In this evolving world, we would expect employers to be already providing adequate breaks. It is beneficial that one has a chance to re-energise, as Sue Moroney suggested, to re-hydrate, restore energy, and health levels and focus as well. So that is a positive in this bill.

It is a balance that the Māori Party has
 consistently advocated for—the need to respect the mana that every iwi and hapū express over their coastal marine areas, while at the same time promoting the concept of enduring public access. That, then, is perhaps at the heart of the question that the Prime Minister put. This generation must the one to open the next chapter of history by providing certainty and clarity around interests in the foreshore and seabed. But this is where we differ in some respects from the approach taken by Mr Key.

We will never forget the memory of 25,000 people marching on Parliament to universally reject the Act. Our international reputation has been damaged by consistent findings from the United Nations that the Act discriminated against Māori because it extinguished property rights without consent or compensation.

 On 24 February 2000 a simultaneous English-Māori translation service was installed in the Māori Affairs Committee room so that direct English translations of members of Parliament or visitors speaking in te reo can be made. At the time, then Deputy Clerk of the House Ailsa Salt said that if the service was a success it could be introduced into the House. We have also had an interpreter in the House since 1999, after Māori members of Parliament expressed concerns during the 1996-99 Parliament about the barriers to speaking Māori in the House. So I want to recognise the efforts made right across the House, in successive terms of Parliament, for the right to be able to speak Māori and for it to be given the status of an official language, with the capacity for other members to benefit from an immediate understanding of the concepts and statements expressed.

So I say to us, in the short time I have been given, that we should not be afraid to stand before the fire, so to speak. Why do I say that? During this year and just recently, the Treaty of Waitangi was hotly debated. The Māori flag has been a topic of discussion, as well. Some people have tried to divide us. My advice is not to fear the Treaty of Waitangi, it will not bite you. Do not fear the tino rangatiratanga flag, it will not bite or kick you. The flag and the Treaty of Waitangi bring us together. Therefore, do not reject the Treaty of Waitangi. Its purpose is to unite us, and that is why I ask you to think carefully during the Christmas break about what I am saying. Aside from talking about money, or humorous speeches, that is fine. But I and the Māori Party urge you to think about what unites us, not what divides us.

This one-off payment from the Government settles the agreement reached in 2004 whereby the Government agreed to nearly 20 percent of pre-existing space and 20 percent of future space.

We know that in the health sector, for example, people talk about participation, they talk about protection, and they talk about partnership. In terms of this Immigration Bill we hope that participation, in terms of setting the rules, and partnership, in terms of coming together with others—not by ourselves—to be able to set the scene in respect of immigration are important aspects.

He referred to the fact that Te Tiriti o Waitangi guaranteed a developing social contract: a partnership of the two cultures. At its very core were expectations that Māori, as a Treaty partner, should be consulted on every aspect concerning migrants who wished to reside here. In the past we have put up Supplementary Order Papers to try to find that space, whether it be through establishing a consultative body over immigration policy or by being actively involved by way of providing education programmes.']"

He said: “For the supercity to have a chance of working it is crucial it has the confidence of all significant sectors of Auckland, particularly Maori.” That is what he said. Auckland Māori have said in no uncertain terms that they need Māori seats in order to gain the assured, authentic voice of Māori at the top table of Auckland governance, and that they need to have confidence in the new Auckland Council. It was Mr Northey who raised the lousy record of Auckland voters in electing only eight Māori to the Auckland City Council throughout its long, 138-year history. I can say, because I am a teacher, that that is an average of one Māori appointed every 17 years. Despite my relation the Hon Mita Ririnui saying that the Māori Party members have not been, he should know that we have been in there from the start. He knows that, so I am not too sure why he mentioned that kōrero. We have not been able to support this bill, because it simply does not provide for Māori representation in the governance structure of the proposed Auckland City.']"

We said that it was a specific recommendation of the Royal Commission on Auckland Governance, that it was consistent with current provisions in the Local Government Act 2002, and that dedicated Māori seats uphold the partnership relationship established between Māori and the Crown through the Treaty of Waitangi, including the partnership established with mana whenua of Auckland. This position has been underscored by the many public submissions received by the Auckland Governance Legislation Committee, which has been examining the Local Government (Auckland Council) Bill, with the report noting that substantial support was received for reserved seats for Māori.']"

That is the issue. Do we accept that principle? Mr Hide is a principled man, and that is the principle we should be talking about, not “special seats”, as he termed it. We are not asking for special seats; we are asking for our seats—mana whenua seats that acknowledge the connection of Māori of Tāmaki-makau-rau to the land. That is what we are talking about.

This bill amends the Crimes Act by repealing sections that provide for the defence of provocation. In current law a person charged with murder can have the charge reduced to manslaughter if he or she caused death under provocation. It is partial defence, in that the defendant is still charged with the killing but able to avoid longer sentences. The Law Commission’s 2007 report recommended that the partial defence of provocation be abolished. However, it is not used often, and often has not been successful. Of the 81 murder cases between 2001 and 2005, 15 used the defence of provocation, of which five were successful. It is another case of a law that has its origins not just in the last century, but the 17th century, and was brought here in the Criminal Code Act 1893, which required that homicide should have been committed “in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation”.

That is how ridiculous this type of law is. This is a
 crucial statement, because, according to research by Victoria University law professor Elisabeth McDonald, the majority of provocation cases are when a man argues he killed because of a perception that his sexuality or sexual pride was being threatened. Formerly, provocation was the “crime of passion”, implying that infidelity was a valid justification for a man to kill, and, as a consequence, the woman being killed. More recently, in the 1990s, some Court of Appeal judgments stated that infidelity is not enough to deprive the ordinary person of self-control. More recently, the defence of provocation has been used as a defence in the killing of gay men, leading to an outcry that this is a “homosexual panic defence”.</em>, '\n', <strong>

In the Court of Appeal, the description “slow-burning anger or passion” was used as being a characteristic of the Samoan people, implying that a racial or ethnic tendency towards sudden passion may well be seen as a characteristic of the offender. We cannot see the sense in this line of thinking. Confusion is the outcome. Section 27 of the Sentencing Act 2002 makes it explicit that offenders may request that the court hear views on the personal, family, community, and cultural background of the offender. That can ensure that the background may be related to the offence, and, importantly, processes are available to resolve issues relating to the offence, involving the offender and his or her family or community, and the victim or victims of the offence. These are really important provisions that allow for social considerations. Therefore, because there is already provision within the Sentencing Act, albeit provision that is tragically underused, we do not think the concerns around cultural knowledge justify retaining the defence of provocation.</em>, '\n', <strong>

The implication for the defence of provocation is that the response is a sudden, angry outburst rather than a slow-burning build-up. Yet how crazy is this?

 </em>, <strong></strong>, <em>The first aspect is the new definition of forestry business to include permanent forest sink initiative activities, so that all foresters receive the same tax treatment. Basically it clarifies the state of play, so that the expenses of participants in the permanent forest sink initiative can now be treated as forestry business expenses for tax purposes. The permanent forest sink initiative, as the House will be aware, is a climate change initiative in which a person intending to reforest can, in exchange for meeting certain conditions, receive emission units. Under current practice, the earning of these emission units may not
 always constitute a forestry business under the Income Tax Acts, whereas forestry businesses are entitled under the Act to more favourable tax treatment than other businesses. So the simple change introduced in this bill is that the reference to forestry business is now amended to include initiatives under the p</em>, <strong></strong>, <em>ermanent forest sink initiative.
 Since permanent forest sink initiative foresters should receive the same treatment as foresters who carry on a forestry business, the amendment defines “forestry business” in section YA 1 of the Income Tax Act 2007 to include permanent forest sink activities.

The bill introduces new resident withholding tax rates on interest paid to individuals, to bring them into line with recent changes to personal tax rates. In particular, the bill introduces a new default rate of 38 percent for people who do not notify their bank of their correct tax rate.

In 2007, Handicap International confirmed 13,306 deaths and injuries due to cluster munitions. The devastation created by the cluster bomblets was lethal. Fragments of jagged steel released were impaled in the body of the person and caused injuries to hands, feet, and eyes, with the outcome being severe disabilities, and families deprived of their breadwinner. Communities become vulnerable as surviving victims are unable to play the role they formerly played. If that is not enough, farmland and water sources can deteriorate due to submunition contamination. Unexploded bomblets become hidden killers, submerged around coastlines just waiting for innocent children to discover. Death is the outcome in the end.

That whakataukī is saying that to be effective, timing is everything. I have been thinking about that simple message as we have looked into the forestry sector amendments as they apply to the New Zealand emissions trading scheme.

It goes without saying that we are mindful of the advice from the Climate Change Iwi Leadership Group people, including Api Māhuika of Ngāti Porou, Timi te Heuheu of Ngāti Tūwharetoa, Mark Solomon of Ngāi Tahu, and other iwi actively engaged in the emissions trading scheme. The group supported the delay. Ngāi Tahu are comfortable with the delay, and I understand that the Central North Island Iwi Collective have also passed a resolution supporting the delay on the basis that they have been given assurances that their position would be no worse.

We know that there is likely to be a split view across different iwi with forestry interests depending on whether they supported the emissions trading scheme in the first place, but there are other layers to the complexity. Reaction to this bill may depend on whether an iwi is a part of the Central North Island settlement group, whether they want to settle or not, or whether, like Ngāti Tūwharetoa, they have forest lands included in the Central North Island settlement and extensive forest estates outside of it. It is a complex picture and it is vital that we get it right, not hurry for the sake of political expediency. We must take care to consider how we meet the Kyoto obligations and how we can protect the climatic systems from excess carbon emissions, while also considering the adjustments required specifically to achieve fair and equitable provisions for the forest sector.']"

Their concern was chiefly to do with their land; they considered it to be the most suitable for conversion to another commercial use. Ngāi Tahu purchased this land before 2002, when the Government\r\n announced its intention to introduce some form of deforestation controls. Ngāi Tahu were therefore unable to take advantage of the 2002-08 period to deforest key areas of land, as many owners of the pre-1990 forests have done. In fact, they concluded that Ngāi Tahu would suffer a disproportionate and significant liability as a result. The financial costs for Ngāi Tahu would be huge in scope. It was the thinking of Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu that land returned as a part of a Treaty settlement that falls into those categories should be excluded. Ngāti Awa of the Whakatāne area, meanwhile, believed that those iwi in the same position as them should be eligible for a one-off adjustment to choose how they wish to use their lands in the future, without reference to the emissions trading scheme. Such an option would have meant that they can make the choice that they originally envisaged they would have when they purchased the forest, and therefore be required to comply with the emissions trading scheme.']"

That is taken for granted. But when we get to this bill, what we see is significant inequality of treatment of Māori.

I must acknowledge all of you who spoke tonight because we were of the same mind. Yes, this is an important matter and we should discuss and debate it because it has been on hold for quite some time. The pleasing aspect is that we have a good grasp of the intent of this bill. There is no lack of understanding and awareness of its intent. Let us say, we are fully aware of its rationale, direction, and focus.

That bill has now been referred to a select committee. The second bill we put in the ballot was this bill, the Public Works (Offer Back of and Compensation for Acquired Land) Amendment Bill. We know that the chances of putting a bill in the hat and having it drawn out on the same day are pretty slim. But what happened? Well, I did a very good karakia on that day, because out came the bill! And 2 years on, here we are tonight debating this bill.']"
